1. Introduction 
The past 25 years have witnessed an unprecedented educational expansion in developing countries. Most 
children in the world now have access to school. By 2015, enrollment in primary education in low‐income 
countries reached 80 percent, compared to 42 percent in 1990 (World Bank 2017).2 Children also stay in 
school longer. Average years of schooling among adults almost doubled, from 3.9 years in 1980 to 7.5 
years  in  2010  (Lee  and  Lee  2016).  However,  increased  schooling  does  not  automatically  translate  into 
better  learning  outcomes  for  all  children.  In  many  places  in  Africa,  Latin  American,  and  South  Asia, 
students who have completed primary education still cannot read or add two‐digit numbers (Majgaard 
and Mingat 2012; Dundar et al. 2014; Pritchett, Banerji, and Kenny 2013). Even in middle‐income countries, 
students  learn  much  less  than  their  peers  in  rich  countries  (World  Bank  2018).  The  Programme  for 
International Student Assessment (PISA) 2015 survey shows that the 15‐year‐old top performers (above 
the 75th percentile) in mathematics in the Dominican Republic, Algeria, Kosovo and Tunisia scored lower 
than  those  at  the  25th  percentile  of  the  OECD  average  (Figure  1)  (OECD  2016).  Other  international 
assessments show similar trends (Mullis et al. 2016; PASEC 2015; Pizarro et al. 2016).  
Governments are searching for more innovative and effective ways to improve learning.  This not only 
translates into ongoing efforts to try new education interventions, but also increased use of experimental 
or quasi‐experimental methods to measure the impacts of these interventions. By 2016, there were more 
than 350 impact evaluation studies with learning outcomes from low‐ and middle‐income countries; in 
2000, there were only about 32 (Evans and Popova 2016; World Bank 2018). Indeed, there is a wide range 
of possible education interventions, from providing school meals to students to offering cash transfers 
conditional on school attendance; from giving free learning materials to students to training teachers in 
new instructional techniques; from constructing new schools to strengthening school management; and 
from increasing parental engagement to promoting community‐based monitoring. Recent syntheses seek 
to evaluate the relative impact of these types of interventions.3  
This  paper  has  two  objectives.  The  first  objective  is  to  propose  widely  comprehensible  metrics  for 
reporting the impact of interventions that seek to improve learning. Education economists and specialists 
generally  report  the  effectiveness  of  an  intervention  in  term  of  “standard  deviations,”  which  may  be 
difficult  for  non‐specialists  to  understand.  For  the  vast  majority  of  the  population,  from  a  Minister  of 
Finance to a rural parent, what does it mean that a new educational policy increases student learning by 
0.2 standard deviation? Not much. In this paper, we use two alternative approaches to quantify the impact 
sizes of different interventions. The first approach is to compare gains to learning in business‐as‐usual 
schooling,  as  above.  We  call  these  equivalent  years  of  schooling  (EYOS),  as  in,  “A  given  learning 
intervention  delivers  the  equivalent  of  1.5  years  of  ‘business‐as‐usual’  schooling”  in  terms  of  learning 
outcomes. The second approach is to put a dollar amount on increased learning by estimating the long‐
term  labor  market  returns,  an  approach  often  adopted  in  the  cost‐effectiveness  analysis  of  health

   This is net enrollment, which is the percentage of children who are of primary‐school age that are enrolled in 
primary school. Gross enrollment – the number of children of any age that are enrolled in primary school divided 
by the number of children of primary‐school age – rose from 61 percent to 103 percent over the same period. Net 
enrollment numbers extend back to 1999, so previous years are a simple extrapolation relative to gross 
enrollment; however, that relationship was steady between 1999 and 2015.  
3
   There have been many syntheses of evidence to improve learning in recent years. Evans and Popova (2016) 
synthesize six of these synthesis studies. A recent synthesis which covers a wide range of recent interventions is 
Snilstveit et al. (2015), summarized in Snilstveit et al. (2016).  

                                                                                                                     2 
 
interventions.  If  an  intervention  increases  learning  and  the  effects  can  be  sustained  in  human  capital 
accumulation, we can calculate the lifelong wage gains from that increased learning. We use the returns 
to cognitive skills among adults to project the effects of improved learning on lifetime earnings.4 The net 
present value (NPV) of lifetime earnings is – on the one hand – a reductive way to think about the value 
of improved learning, but it has the distinct advantage of allowing concrete discussion of the potential 
returns to education interventions, which may facilitate discussions of education investments relative to 
other investments with non‐education experts, such as Ministers of Finance.  
The second objective is to characterize the size of the impacts of these interventions relative to learning 
in  a  business‐as‐usual  setting.  The  motivation  for  the  first  objective  is  that  a  common  critique  of  the 
learning interventions characterized above is that the average effect is inadequate to make a substantive 
difference (Alkire et al. 2018). For example, the median effect of pedagogical interventions from a recent 
review – including experimental and quasi‐experimental studies – was 0.13 standard deviation in learning 
(Snilstveit et al. 2015). The median effect across randomized controlled trials in a recent systematic review 
(McEwan 2015) was 0.07 standard deviation. But how much do students learn in their education systems 
normally? Are these effects small or big next to a realistic counterfactual of education in low‐ and middle‐
income countries? This paper characterizes the size of a range of learning interventions relative to what 
students normally learn in school in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
Of  course,  knowing  the  returns  is  only  one  side  of  the  equation:  adding  cost  data  would  allow  policy 
makers not only to understand the metric by which the benefits  are measured, but also to make fully 
informed  decisions.  Unfortunately,  cost  data  are  reported  far  less  systematically  and  less  often  than 
impact estimates. However, recent work has provided estimates across a range of studies (J‐PAL 2014). 
We use those estimates to demonstrate how our method – of translating learning gains into equivalent 
years  of  schooling  and  into  increased  potential  earnings  –  could  be  extended  to  demonstrate  the 
equivalent years of schooling (EYOS) per $100 and the benefit‐cost ratio of investment.  
To  convert  test  score  gains  into  additional  years  of  schooling  or  increased  wages,  we  use  data  on  the 
relative wages and the relative schooling of individuals with different levels of cognitive performance. A 
group of new, comparable international assessments measuring adult cognitive skills in low‐ and middle‐
income  countries,  the  Skills  Towards  Employability  and  Productivity  program  (STEP),  along  with  some 
other,  stand‐alone  surveys  provide  exactly  that  (Hanushek  et  al.  2015;  Valerio,  Sánchez  Puerta,  et  al. 
2016a; Díaz, Arias, and Tudela 2012; Aslam et al. 2011; Valerio, Sanchez‐Puerta, et al. 2016).5  
We  find  that  across  5  STEP  countries,  one  standard  deviation  gain  in  literacy  skill  is  associated  with 
between 4.7 and 6.8 additional years of schooling, depending on the estimation method. In other words, 
over  the  course  of  a  business‐as‐usual  school  year,  students  learn  between  0.15  and  0.21  standard 
deviation of literacy ability.6 At the same time, one promising set of interventions – structured pedagogical 
improvements  (or  improving  the  quality  of  teaching  with  detailed  guidance  to  instructors)  –  has  an 
average effect size of 0.13 standard deviation, which means these interventions help students to learn 
what  they  would  normally  learn  in  between  0.6  and  0.9  years  of  business‐as‐usual  schooling.  Impact

   Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2011) use a similar approach for a single program, to calculate the internal rate 
of return of a teacher performance pay program in India.

   The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) provides similar data for high‐
income countries.

   Because this compares individuals with different completed years of schooling, it is net of the depreciation that 
takes place during the holidays between school years.  

                                                                                                                     3 
 
evaluation  studies  in  the  areas  of  computer‐assisted  learning  and  school‐based  management  yield  an 
average impact that translates to 0.05 to 0.07 additional year of schooling. The impacts of the pedagogical 
improvements are sizeable, suggesting that interventions being explored to improve learning can make a 
significant  difference.  When  one  translates  these  learning  gains  into  the  wage  gains  associated  with 
improved learning, the median wage gains across all pedagogical interventions with positive impacts are 
8 percent, and the wage gains for the intervention with an effect size at the 75th percentile are 21 percent. 
In the latter case, that translates into a net present value of nearly US$24,369 in increased wages, with a 
number of interventions delivering even higher returns.  

2. Empirical Strategy 
2.1 Equivalent Years of Schooling (EYOS)  
To report learning effects in terms of EYOS, ideally one would access a test that maps out the learning 
trajectory of how much students learn from each additional year of schooling. This requires administering 
a test with a vertical scale, which makes scores comparable across different grade levels. For example, the 
states of Utah and Texas in the United States assess student performance in grades 3‐8 for reading and 
math using a vertical scale (Utah Education Association 2013; State of Texas Assessments of Academix 
Readiness 2013). However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing cross‐country tests allow for that 
conversion.  Some  studies  have  attempted  to  estimate  the  learning  gain  from  an  additional  year  of 
schooling in other ways by comparing students of the same age in two different grades (e.g., with the 
Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, which is applied to 15‐year‐olds across countries), 
either seeking to control for confounders in regressions (OECD 2014) or by using age‐cutoffs for grade 
enrollment  to  exogenously  identify  differences  (Strom  2004;  Frenette  2008;  Benton  2014;  Khaw  and 
Wong 2012; Lau and Wong 2013; Marchionni and Vazquez 2015). Neither of these methods maps out a 
trajectory beyond two years, whereas skills may accumulate at different rates over the primary school 
cycle.7  
A few other tests assess reading and numeracy competencies of children in a wide age range, but the 
content of the tests is set at the level of early grades and provides limited information on the learning 
trajectory of later years in the education cycle. For example, the Annual State of Education Report (ASER) 
in  India  and  Pakistan,  Uwezo  in  East  Africa,  and  the  Independent  Measurement  of  Learning  (MIA)  in 
Mexico test the basic reading and numeracy skills of children aged between 5 and 16 through household‐
based  assessments.  In  addition,  these  tests  are  based  on  national  curricula  to  guide  domestic  policy 
dialogue  and  are  not  necessarily  comparable  across  countries  (PAL  Network  2017).  Similar  constraints 
apply  to  the  Early  Grade  Reading  Assessment  (EGRA)  and  the  Early  Grade  Math  Assessment  (EGMA), 
which have been widely used in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia (RTI International 2009).                                              
In  this  paper,  we  use  an  adult  skill  assessment  to  estimate  the  relationship  between  learning  gains 
throughout the primary cycle. The advantage of using adults is that the analysis avoids selection in terms 
of who has achieved a certain grade by a certain age. Selection in total years of schooling remains, to a 
degree that varies by the estimation method. We employ two alternative methods to estimate the EYOS 
associated with one standard deviation in learning. The first uses simple descriptive data to characterize

  Another, related effort seeks to combine the quality and quantity of education into a single cross‐country measure 
– the Learning Adjusted Years of Schooling, or LAYS – to allow comparison of education systems across countries 
(Filmer et al. 2018). While the LAYS allows an aggregate measure of the quantity and quality of education in an 
education system, it is not naturally suited to characterizing the gains from a given intervention. 

                                                                                                                        4 
 
the learning gains through the school career (2.1.1 Method 1: Descriptive learning trajectory). The second 
uses multivariate regression to estimate the learning gains associated with an additional year of schooling, 
accounting  for  a  number  of  background  variables  (2.1.2  Method  2:  OLS  model  of  skills  and  years  of 
schooling).  Both  methods  have  advantages  and  disadvantages,  but  ultimately,  both  point  to  sizeable 
impacts from learning interventions.  
2.1.1 Method 1: Descriptive learning trajectory 
In this section, we create an approximate learning trajectory using descriptive statistics. We first calculate 
standardized  reading  proficiency  scores  by  completed  years  of  schooling,  and  then  we  calculate  the 
increased  proficiency  for  individuals  with  an  additional  year  of  schooling.  For  example,  if  the  average 
reading proficiency score of people who have i years of schooling is ������  and those who have (i+1) years of 
schooling is ������ , the learning gain from one additional year of schooling will be ∆ ������  ‐ ������ . We then 
take  the  simple  average  of  learning  gains  from  grade  1  to  grade  12  as  the  mean  reading  proficiency 
improvement  from  an  additional  year  of  schooling.  The  EYOS  are  estimated  as  1/ ∆ _              .  We  use 
grades 1 through 12 because we observe significant gains in literacy throughout those grades and because 
education past grade 12 no longer focuses on fundamental reading skills.  
Although all curricula mandate that these skills be learned in primary school, the poor quality of education 
in  many  countries  extends  that  learning  curve  into  secondary  school  (Figure  2).  Moreover,  due  to  the 
limited sample size of each country, we include all age groups in the calculation, aware of the fact that 
the quality of the education system varies across generations and there might be potential catch‐up or 
decay effects of learning during adulthood. The advantage of this method is its simplicity; its disadvantage 
is its failure to deal with selection in total years of schooling.  
2.1.2 Method 2: OLS model of skills and years of schooling 
In this section, we adopt a statistical model of an individual’s skills as a simple and restricted function of 
completed years of schooling, following Mincer (1970).   
                                                                  ������     ������������     ������                      (1) 
Where cognitive skills  (C) are measured by skill assessment scores and  S is school attainment. We fully 
acknowledge  that  there  are  factors  other  than  schooling  that  determine  the  formulation  of  skills,  as 
discussed in Hanushek (2002). The purpose of this paper is to characterize potential gains rather than 
make a strict causal claim.  
Following this conceptualization, we estimate the following equation for our analysis:  
                           ������ ������          ������ ������     ������ ������������������          ������ ������ ������������������      ������ ������       ������             (2) 
Where ������  is  the  standardized  reading  proficiency  score  of  individual  i,  S  is  the  number  of  years  of 
schooling,  G  is  an  indicator  of  gender,  and  ������  is  a  stochastic  error.  We  include  age  effects  in  the 
specification, considering the potential learning decay or catch‐up effects in adulthood, which allows the 
learning  gradient  associated  with  additional  schooling  to  vary  by  age.  We  then  use  that  relationship, 
expressed  in ������ , ������ , ������ ,  to  estimate  the  learning  gradient  back  in  one’s  school  age.  Therefore,  the 
learning gain for an individual from an addition year of schooling in terms of standard deviation can be 
estimated as:   
                                    ∆������       ������       ������         ������    ������      ������������������      1                    (3) 


                                                                                                                           5 
 
Correspondingly, one standard deviation in learning gains is associated with 1/∆������ EYOS. With equation 
(3), we can derive an estimate of a full learning profile for each country based on a representative sample 
of the population with different educational attainment, rather than concentrating on a specific age or 
grade group. A standard caveat in a model like equation (2) is that a degree of selection takes place at 
each  grade.  However,  previous  research  work  has  shown  that  the  simple  OLS  and  quasi‐experimental 
designs yield very similar estimates of schooling impacts on learning and earnings (Chetty, Friedman, and 
Rockoff 2014).  
For the conversion of EYOS, we again limit the sample to individuals with up to 12 years of schooling for 
the same reason described in 2.1.1, that learning gains on the skills we measure are sizeable through 12 
years of schooling but smaller after. We report the EYOS estimated based on the learning gain from grade 
6, usually the last year of primary school, as the primary results. We report specifications pooled across 
countries that both include and exclude country fixed effects, and we give each country the same weight 
to compensate for differing sample sizes across countries.  
2.2 Net Present Value of Increased Learning 
There is a vast labor literature examining how wages of workers are determined. A simple estimate of 
individual earnings can be written as in Equation 4, following Hanushek and Woessmann (2008):  
                                                              ������    ������������       ������                                                            (4) 
where earnings (������) are a function of the labor‐market skills or human capital of the individual (������ ). ε is a 
stochastic error, representing idiosyncratic differences in earnings and orthogonal to H. 
Human capital (H) is a latent variable that is hard to measure. A preponderance of empirical research 
has adopted the Mincerian earning equation (5) (Mincer 1970, 1974), where human capital is measured 
by educational attainment (i.e., years of schooling) and on‐the‐job training (i.e., work experience).

An alternative approach is to use directly measured cognitive skills as a proxy for human capital – that is, 
standardized literacy and numeracy tests. The empirical model is an analog to a Mincer equation 
replacing years of schooling with measured literacy skills C. Potential working experience is replaced by 
age, as experience might be endogenous to schooling (Patrinos and Sakellariou 2005).

We estimate the labor market value of improved test scores, conditional on the assumption that increased 
learning from interventions corresponds to a long‐term human capital gain. This is a strong assumption. 
Most impact evaluations of education interventions measure impacts over only a short period; McEwan 
(2015) found the average period between treatment and follow‐up measurement across 70 instructional 
evaluations was 13 months. In some cases, where impacts have been measured over time, the effects 
have been sustained (Ou 2005; Muralidharan 2012); in others, the effects have diminished or disappeared 
(Andrabi et al. 2011; Jacob, Lefgren, and Sims 2010). There are too few long‐term evaluations to draw 
strong  conclusions.  As  such,  this  exercise  seeks  to  translate  the  potential  long‐term  impact  of  human 
capital gains into broadly understandable metrics – increased earnings – without intending to be strictly 
predictive, given the uncertainty of the time path of returns.   

                                                                                                                                                    6 
 
We  assume  that  wage  returns  to  skills  are  constant  across  one’s  working  life  (Buchmann  et  al.  2016). 
Improvement from the same intervention I translates to a ∆������ ∙ ������ predicted wage increase. The average 
annual income of a worker in country ������ is ������ , measured by the labor share of the Gross National Income 
(GNI) per capita. Hence, intervention I yields an additional income of ∆������ ∙ ������ ∙ ������  per year, assuming no 
wage  growth, 8  following  Miguel  and  Kremer  (2004)  and  Muralidharan  and  Sundararaman  (2011). 
Students receive the intervention at age ������  and they are expected to enter the labor market at age 20 
(Muralidharan and Sundararaman 2011). Wage gains will be further discounted by (20‐������ ) years. The net 
present value of additional wage gains can be written as:  
                    
                                                                        ∆������ ∙ ������ ∙ ������

where n = number of years in the workforce and i = discount rate.  
In this paper, the expected work life is assumed to be 40 years and discount rate is taken at 3%, a standard 
social discount rate in public finance (Hanushek and Woessmann 2010; Hagist et al. 2005; Börsch‐Supan 
2000).  
2.3 Cost Effectiveness of Learning Interventions  
Building on the impact metrics, this paper also presents cost‐effectiveness analysis and benefit‐cost ratios 
of  a  range  of  programs  with  available  cost  data  from  J‐PAL  (2014).  The  cost‐effectiveness  of  selected 
interventions is estimated in terms of EYOS per US$100. For instance, we first multiply the point estimate 
of improved learning by ∆������ to get the amount of EYOS for each participant by the program. We then divide 
the  present  value  of  total  costs  of  the  program  (including  costs  to  both  the  implementer  and  the 
beneficiary) by the number of participants to determine the program cost per beneficiary. And we divide 
the amount of EYOS by the cost per individual, then multiply by 100 to express the outcome per a US$100 
investment.  
Benefit‐cost ratios or return to investment (ROI) ratios are calculated as the NPV of lifetime increased 
wage income divided by the NPV of the program costs per individual. All conversions and calculations 
follow the methodology described previously in this section.  

3. Data 
The primary data used in this paper are the World Bank’s STEP Skills Measurement Program. The STEP 
household surveys measure skills of the adult population in low‐ and middle‐income countries and provide 
comparable international scores of reading proficiency on the scale of OECD’s assessment of adult skills, 
the PIAAC (World Bank 2016a). We use the STEP survey data collected between March 2012 and July 2014 
in five countries with available literacy assessment data: Bolivia, Colombia, Ghana, Kenya, and Vietnam.9  



                                                            
8
    Wages  are  highly  likely  to  increase  over  time  and  assuming  no  wage  growth  is  a  conservative  approach. 
Nevertheless, the net present value of increased learning from interventions is considerable.  
9
   Data are also available for Armenia, Ukraine and Georgia but not included for the reason that over 50 percent of 
the population in these countries have more than 12 years of formal education, which dramatically reduces the 
sample size for the analysis in this paper.  

                                                                                                                       7 
 
The STEP survey includes background information of respondents including demographic characteristics, 
education, employment history, and earnings. It also includes a reading literacy assessment, administered 
along with the household survey to a representative sample of urban adults aged 15‐64 in participating 
countries. Respondents were asked to take a paper‐based literacy test that was designed to measure the 
level  of  proficiency  in  literacy  with  respect  to  word  meaning,  sentence  processing  and  basic  passage 
comprehension,  in  the  language  of  their  resident  country.  Scores  were  given  based  on  accuracy  (the 
number of correct answers) and rate (the time taken to answer correctly) on a scale from 0 to 500, as in 
the PIAAC (Pierre et al. 2014).10 For analytical purposes, we standardize scores to have a mean of zero and 
a  within‐country  standard  deviation  of  one  in  country‐specific  analyses  and  standardize  scores  across 
countries when analyzing the pooled sample, following Hanushek et al. (2015) and Valerio, Sánchez Puerta, 
et al. (2016b).11 There is a consistent sampling strategy (see Pierre et al. (2014)) across all STEP participant 
countries  and  this  paper  employs  the  sample  weights  within  each  country  in  the  estimation.  Pooled 
analyses give each country the same weight.  
In both our descriptive learning trajectory model and the linear regression model, we limit the estimation 
sample to survey respondents who have 1‐12 years of schooling. This gives us sample sizes ranging from 
1,558 in Bolivia to 2,503 in Vietnam, as Table 1 Panel A shows. The average age of the pooled sample 
across 5 countries is 32.9 years old, ranging from 28.5 years old in Kenya to 38.1 years old in Vietnam. The 
average years of schooling is 8.9 years, with about 21.2% still at school. Respondents in Vietnam achieve 
the highest reading proficiency score (234) while respondents in Ghana have the lowest (126).  
For the analysis of labor market returns and the net present value of lifetime earnings, we restrict the 
sample to adults between 25 and 64 years old who are in the labor force regardless of employment status, 
since the level of skills matters in both job seeking and job performance. It includes the following groups: 
(1)  the  full‐time  and  part‐time  employed  (including  self‐employed)  population,  and  (2)  those  who  are 
unemployed but have been looking for jobs in the past four weeks and will be available in the next two 
weeks. We exclude individuals who are not in the labor force, specifically those who are not employed 
and did not look for work in the past four weeks, either because they self‐identify as housewives (47.0%), 
are retired or in old age (24.0%), are ill or disabled (7.9%), are currently attending school (6.1%), do not 
want to work or believe there are no jobs (3.4%), and for other reasons (11.6%). The earnings measure 
used is weekly wages in US dollars. The top 1 percent of weekly earners (likely due to reporting error) are 
excluded from the sample, as were those who did not report their wages (5% of those who report working). 
The earnings of unemployed people and unpaid workers are set at 0.00001 for estimation purposes.  
Table 1 Panel B provides summary statistics of this subsample. The sample size ranges between 1,228 in 
Bolivia  and  1,948  in  Kenya,  with  a  total  of  8,156  observations  in  the  pooled  sample.  Vietnam  has  the 
highest employment rate at 98.0%, and the lowest rate is 83.1% in Kenya. Hourly wage ranges from $2.8 
(PPP 2011) in Ghana to $4.6 in Bolivia. Respondents in Vietnam achieve the highest literacy score (237) 
and respondents in Ghana the lowest (121). The average years of schooling ranges from 11.1 in Bolivia to 
7.8 years in Ghana. 

                                                            
10
    The STEP survey also collected data on socioemotional skills, but we focus on the measured cognitive skills (i.e., 
reading proficiency) in the empirical specification, as this is the most consistently measured learning outcome in 
education impact evaluations.  
11
    All 10 plausible values of the STEP reading proficiency scores are taken into account using the STEP module in 
Stata 14 (Macdonald 2014). 

                                                                                                                     8 
 
For interventions, we begin with the sample of impact evaluation studies in the areas with the largest 
number  of  measured  learning  outcomes  in  a  systematic  review  (Snilstveit  et  al.  2015):  structured 
pedagogy (e.g., introducing new lesson content and providing teachers with training on how to teach), 
computer‐assisted learning, and school based management. We only include studies with any measure of 
the three building blocks of the STEP literacy assessment – word meaning, sentence processing and basic 
passage  comprehension  –  to  ensure  the  comparability  to  the  extent  possible,  and  sort  them  by 
standardized effect size.12 Forty‐nine of the total 63 reading outcomes analyzed in this paper are from 
impact evaluations that employ randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and the rest are from studies using 
either difference‐in‐differences (DID) or multivariate regression evaluation designs. In order to estimate 
the  potential  increase  in  average  annual  income  associated  with  an  intervention,  we  use  the  GNI  per 
capita, PPP (current international $)  combined with the  labor share of national income of the  country 
where  the  intervention  was  implemented  (World  Bank  2017;  Neiman  and  Karabarbounis  2013).  To 
compare all the interventions in the same time frame, we assume that all interventions began in 2015 
(Buchmann et al. 2016).  
For  cost‐effectiveness  analysis,  a  recent  study  by  J‐PAL  (2014)  provides  standardized  effect  sizes  and 
program costs of 27 education interventions with student learning outcomes across Sub‐Saharan Africa 
and Asia. Our analysis includes 14 of those 27 programs with a significant impact at the 10% level. We 
estimate the equivalent years of schooling per $100 and the rate of return on investment. The cost data 
from J‐PAL in general consider costs to the implementer such as administrative and monitoring costs and 
the  opportunity  costs  of  the  beneficiary  and  their  family  (see  Dhaliwal  et  al.  (2013)  for  details  on 
methodology). To follow the time frame of J‐PAL’s data, all calculations related to cost‐effectiveness and 
cost‐benefit analysis are expressed in USD (2011 PPP).  
4. Results  
4.1 Increased Learning as EYOS 
Across five STEP countries, we find that one standard deviation improvement in reading proficiency is 
associated with 4.7 to 6.8 EYOS, estimated by using our two different methods (Table 2).13 In other words, 
it takes between 4.7 and 6.8 years of “business‐as‐usual” schooling to produce one standard deviation of 
learning. The descriptive method (Method 1) indicates the biggest EYOS of 6.8, while the estimate from 
the OLS model without country fixed effects (Method 2b) corresponds to 4.7 EYOS. However, Method 1 
does  not  consistently  predict  larger  EYOS  across  countries.  In  Colombia,  the  smallest  EYOS  of  4.8  is 
estimated through Method 1 and the largest (9.3) through Method 2. In Ghana, Method 2 indicates an 
EYOS  of  4.4  and  Method  1  yields  an  EYOS  of  7.3.  Nevertheless,  although  each  method  is  based  on  a 
different  set  of  reasonable  assumptions,  the  results  consistently  demonstrate  the  sizable  impacts  of 
improved reading proficiency.  
 EYOS estimated through alternative benchmarks  
Our  results  from  the  pooled  sample  show  that  an  additional  year  of  schooling  increases  reading 
proficiency by 0.15 standard deviation (method 1), that is how much a student learns if she studies in a 
hypothetical “STEP” school, which reflects a mix of the education systems of the 5 countries. How much

    Tables A2, A3 and A4 provide details on learning gains associated with an additional year of schooling that are 
used to estimate EYOS.  

                                                                                                                       9 
 
is the “STEP” school gain in cognitive skill compared to that in other education systems? First, we can 
compare  the  absolute  learning  gains.  Using  PIACC  data  from  Hanushek  et  al.  (2015)  and  the  same 
descriptive  method  (method  1),  we  estimate  that  students  from  Finland  –  one  of  the  top  performing 
education  systems  –  improve  reading  proficiency  by  approximately  0.3  standard  deviation  with  an 
additional year of schooling, or one standard deviation is an equivalent of 3.3 years of Finnish schooling. 
Similarly, the average improvement in reading from an additional year of schooling in grades 3‐8 in Texas 
is  also  about  0.3  standard  deviation,  or  one  standard  deviation  is  an  equivalent  of  3.3  EYOS  of  Texas 
education.  Hence,  in  absolute  terms,  students  in  these  two  countries  learn  about  twice  as  much  as 
students in the 5 STEP countries.  

However, taking the quality of education systems into account, students in high‐performing systems learn 
even more. Although one additional year of schooling is associated with 0.3 standard deviation in both 
Texas  and  Finland,  it  does  not  mean  that  students  in  Texas  and  Finland  make  the  same  improvement 
within one school year, because the quality of the two education systems is not the same. This can be 
illustrated by the fact that within the PIAAC pooled sample, with a common test, an additional year of 
schooling in the US is associated with 0.2 standard deviation of reading proficiency improvement, while 
that number is 0.3 standard deviation in Finland.14 In this paper, we propose the pooled STEP standard as 
a metric for low‐ and middle‐income countries for two reasons. First, we do not have data for all countries 
where the interventions were implemented; second, we try to evaluate the impacts of interventions using 
the same STEP EYOS to avoid biases from the variance in the quality of different education systems.  

4.2 Impacts of Increasing Cognitive Skills  
The data available to calculate the relationship between cognitive skills and earnings are available in only 
a  limited  number  of  countries.  In  fact,  only  two  countries  (Colombia  and  Kenya)  have  both  data  on 
cognitive skills and earnings as well as impact evaluations results from an expansive database (Snilstveit 
et al. 2015). As a result, we use the return to learning estimated using the pooled sample to demonstrate 
the  potential  impacts  of  interventions.  Taking  these  numbers  as  predictive  would  require  strong 
assumptions  that  interventions  across  countries  would  have  the  same  effect,  which  is  not  the  case. 
However,  these  estimates  are  intended  to  be  demonstrative  rather  than  predictive.  Again,  we 
acknowledge  the  limitations  of  this  extrapolation,  but  we  propose  that  this  work  still  serves  to 
demonstrate  the  potential  returns  to  learning  interventions.  Over  time,  more  data  on  the  return  to 
cognitive ability will improve the precision of this exercise.   
Table 3 shows the effect sizes at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of three categories of interventions: 
structured pedagogy, school‐based management and computer assisted learning. Table A5 shows the full 
list of interventions. These impacts correspond to EYOS estimated through three sets of methods. Across 
all pedagogical interventions that have been evaluated, the median effect size is 0.13 standard deviation.15 
If the effect were sustained over time, the increased learning from this program would have an impact 
equivalent to an additional 0.52 to 0.88 EYOS, depending on the estimation method. Likewise, a more 
promising  intervention  –  a  decentralized  schooling  system  intervention  in  Brazil  that  provided  new 
curriculum, teaching materials and teacher training – yielded an impact that corresponds to 1.16 EYOS 
under the most conservative approach and reaches 2 years of equivalent schooling using the descriptive

   Calculations are available upon request.

   That median effect is from an intervention in Kenya that provided teachers with teaching manuals, training and 
follow‐up workshops (Jukes and Dubeck 2015). 

                                                                                                                   10 
 
method. For school‐based management and computer‐assisted learning interventions, the effect sizes are 
smaller  and  the  effect  sizes  at  the  25th  percentile  are  negative.  However,  the  median  effect  size  of 
computer‐assisted learning interventions is 0.01, from a computer‐assisted remedial program in China 
(Lai et al. 2011), which is associated with 0.04 ‐ 0.07 EYOS. The impact of one of the most promising school‐
based management interventions (75th percentile) – a school grant program in Senegal (Carneiro et al. 
2015) – is equal to 0.27 EYOS.  
Furthermore, there are labor market returns to increased learning, as discussed earlier. Returns to one 
standard deviation higher literacy score in different regions are shown in Table 4. Based on returns to 
literacy  skills,  we  can  estimate  the  net  present  value  of  increased  lifetime  earnings  from  a  certain 
education  intervention,  as  shown  in  Table  5  (for  a  sample  of  interventions)  and  Table  A6  (for  all 
interventions). The underlying assumption is that the effects will be sustained over one’s lifetime.  

For example, Table 4 suggests returns of 59 percent for scoring 1 standard deviation higher on the literacy 
assessment  in  Kenya.  The  Health  and  Literacy  Intervention  (HALI)  (Jukes  et  al.  2016)  helped  students 
achieve 0.13 standard deviation higher in a Swahili passage reading fluency (words per minute) test (Table 
5). The long‐term impact of this program would be an 8 percent increase in wages [0.59 * 0.13 SD]. The 
average annual income of a Kenyan worker in 2015 was $1,079 (PPP, current US$) [3,060 * 0.35 SD] and 
an 8 percent increase in wage would correspond to additional income of $86 per year. Over a 40‐year 
work life, this fixed additional income has a present value of $1,907, if discounted at 3 percent. Since the 
students are in Grade 2 or on average 8 years old and they are assumed to start to enter the labor market 
at age 20, the $1,907 is further discounted by 3 percent for another 12 years. The net present value of the 
learning  improvement  from  the  HALI  for  each  student  is  $1,338  (Table  5).  Similarly,  the  Brazilian 
decentralized  schooling  system  which  implemented  new  curriculum  and  teacher  training  (Leme  et  al. 
2012),  can  potentially  yield  an  NPV  of  $24,369  by  improving  students’  Portuguese  proficiency  by  0.29 
standard deviation.  
The  computer‐assisted  intervention  with  the  75th  percentile  effect  size  is  a  program  implemented  in 
Ecuador, which provided computer labs and learning software and increased students’ learning outcome 
by 0.06 standard deviation, as shown in Table 5 (Carrillo, Onofa, and Ponce 2010). Since we do not have 
data on the return to learning in Ecuador, we use that of Colombia, the country in Latin America closest 
to Ecuador in income for which we have data in our sample. The 0.04 standard deviation improvement in 
language skills corresponds to a 4 percent increase in wages, with an NPV of $3,093. Likewise, the median 
effect  size  of  school‐based  management  interventions,  from  a  school  grant  program  in  The  Gambia 
(Blimpo et al. 2015), can potentially translate to a wage increase of NPV $20.  
4.3 The Cost Effectiveness of Increased Learning 
While Sections 4.1 and 4.2 have demonstrated the potential impacts of increased learning from improving 
pedagogy in terms of increased years of schooling and lifetime increased wage income. In this section, we 
present cost‐effectiveness and cost‐benefit ratios of a group of programs, by adding the data on program 
costs. We include 14 education programs that cover a wide range of intervention categories, including 
conditional  cash  transfers,  teacher  incentives,  computer‐assisted  learning,  school‐based  management 
and providing textbooks (Table 6). Following the practice in the previous sections, we group and compare 
these interventions by region. While we can compare specific interventions in this way, we have data on 
too  few  interventions  to  responsibly  make  generalizations  about  the  cost‐effectiveness  of  entire 
categories of interventions to set policy priorities (e.g., computer‐assisted learning versus school‐based 

                                                                                                                 11 
 
management).  However,  this  exercise  demonstrates  the  potential  of  cost‐effectiveness  analysis  in 
complementing our analysis to inform policy decisions.  
Across  all  14  included  programs,  the  average  total  cost  per  participant  is  US$75  (2011,  PPP),  with  the 
cheapest at  US$0.40 (from providing  earnings information for school finishers in  Madagascar (Nguyen 
2008b)) and the most expensive at US$749 (from the minimum‐size conditional cash transfer program in 
Malawi (Baird, McIntosh, and Özler 2011)) (Table 6).  
In  Sub‐Saharan  Africa,  the  most  cost‐effective  program  provided  households  in  Madagascar  with 
information on returns to education (Nguyen 2008a). As Table 6 shows, this program increased students’ 
learning performance by 0.2 SD at a cost of US$0.4 per student. As described in section 4.1, 1 one SD gain 
in  learning  is  associated  with  6.5  years  of  equivalent  schooling  (method  2a).  Thus,  the  effect  of  the 
Madagascar program translates into 1.5 additional years of schooling for each participant at a total cost 
of  US$0.4  from  implementer  and  beneficiary.  In  other  words,  an  investment  of  US$100  can  yield  430 
additional years of equivalent schooling (if that were possible). Furthermore, considering the long‐term 
wage income effects described in section 4.2.2, an 0.2 SD improvement in learning by this program can 
yield an NPV of US$694 from lifetime increased wage income (discounted at 3%), which provides a benefit‐
cost ratio of 1,957, when taking into account the NPV of the program cost (US$0.4). The median cost‐
effective program in Sub‐Saharan Africa took place in Kenya and provided teachers with incentives based 
on  students’  test  scores  and  improved  learning  by  0.14  SD  at  a  cost  of  US$4.2  per  beneficiary  (Duflo, 
Dupas, and Kremer 2011). For every US$100 invested in this program, it is associated with additional 21.3 
years of equivalent schooling and the benefit‐cost ratio reaches 156, when benefits are estimated in terms 
of life‐time increased earnings. The big returns indicate the high cost‐effectiveness of these interventions 
that effectively increased learning. 
Establishing new schools is considered to be one of the most expensive education investments. However, 
building these new schools can still be cost‐effective as long as children get sizeable learning gains. In 
Afghanistan, placing village‐based schooling helped children improve their performance by 0.5 SD at a 
higher cost of US$111.2 per student enrolled (Burde and Linden 2013). 18.1 additional years of equivalent 
schooling can be achieved per US$100 and the benefit‐cost ratio is 19 (Table 6). In East Asia, the impact 
of  an  school‐based  management  intervention  in  Indonesia  (Pradhan  et  al.  2014)  that  linked  school 
committees  to  local  government  translates  to  187  additional  years  of  equivalent  schooling  for  every 
US$100  invested,  generating  a  benefit‐cost  ratio  of  3,810.  Similarly,  in  India,  a  remedial  education 
program improved students’ performance by 0.14 SD, which yields a benefit‐cost ratio of 143.  

5. Discussion  
5.1 Poverty impacts 
A wide range of interventions have increased learning outcomes in low‐ and middle‐income countries. 
This increased learning can translate into labor market gains, as adults with higher learning scores have 
higher wages. An 11 percent increase in wages, the projected increase associated with a teacher training 
program in Uganda, or a 33 percent increase in wages, associated with a reading program in Kenya, mean 
a sizeable difference for those countries, with roughly one‐third of the population living under the $1.90 
per day poverty line (World Bank 2016b).16 If that one‐third were to have income uniformly distributed 
                                                            
16
  The last available poverty estimates for Uganda are from 2012 (34.6 percent) and for Kenya are from 2005 (33.6 
percent).  

                                                                                                                   12 
 
under $1.90 poverty (a conservative assumption), then an 11 percent increase in wages would translate 
to a reduction in extreme poverty from 34 percent to 30 percent (more than one million people in Uganda), 
and a 33 percent increase in wages would translate to a reduction in extreme poverty of 23 percent (more 
than three million people in Kenya). These are not small or trivial changes.  
5.2 How reliable are the assumptions on which this is based? 
Of course, these numbers are based on a wide range of strong assumptions. First, there is an assumption 
that cognitive impacts endure from the time of the intervention into adulthood. As discussed earlier, the 
evidence on the endurance of cognitive gains is extremely limited. Few education interventions measure 
outcomes over a significant period of time. Impacts likely endure in some cases and not in others.   
Second, because we do not have data on the gradient between cognitive skills and earnings for every 
country, we use that of the country in the same region that has the closest income to the country where 
the intervention took place. For example, we only have data on returns to schooling in Ghana and Kenya 
in the Sub‐Saharan Africa region. When we estimate the economic return to an intervention in Tanzania, 
we will use the gradient of Kenya, since Tanzania’s income is closer to Kenya’s than to Ghana’s. But the 
returns to schooling in terms of weekly earnings vary greatly within the region, from 9.8 percent in Ghana 
to 21.8 percent in Kenya. There is clearly no reason to be confident that the gradient in Tanzania will in 
fact be 15.8 percent. As such, estimates for countries where data are available on the learning‐earnings 
gradient will likely be more accurate. Likewise, calculating the EYOS from five pooled countries and then 
using  that  pooled  estimate  to  scale  up  the  effect  sizes  assumes  consistency  in  the  estimates  across 
countries, which – as shown above – is not met. The objective of the metric is to provide a rule of thumb 
rather than a measure that will be precisely accurate in every setting, which would be impossible.  
Third, if one were to use these estimates to think about poverty reduction or income gains on a national 
scale,  then  they  assume  a  lack  of  general  equilibrium  effects:  Specifically,  if  one  were  to  scale  up  an 
education intervention nationwide, would the size of the impacts on earnings be consistent? This could 
prove false because the quality of the program diminishes in the context of scaling it up, as documented 
in Kenya in Bold et al. (2015). This could also prove false if the population as a whole achieves higher 
cognitive  ability  and  so  the  returns  fall  in  response  to  the  increased  supply  of  cognitive  ability,  as 
documented in India in Khanna (2015). 
Fourth,  one  of  the  metrics  that  this  paper  uses  is  “equivalent  years  of  schooling.”  However,  this  only 
captures  the  cognitive  gains  from  additional  years  of  schooling.  Insofar  as  schooling  produces 
socioemotional skills – as documented in the United States by Jackson (2016) – the equivalent years of 
schooling are an incomplete representation of total skills.  
5.3 What is the ultimate value of these estimates for education policy? 
Despite their limitations, these alternative units allow both education and non‐education specialists to 
characterize  gains  in  learning  in  terms  that  are  understandable  and  are  clearly  linked  to  positive  life 
outcomes. A statement such as, “The gains from this literacy intervention are the same as the difference 
between someone who earns $60,000 a year and someone who earns $70,000 a year,” arguably carries 
much more intuitive meaning – even with all the necessary caveats – than “This intervention increased 
learning by 0.22 standard deviation.”  
The sizeable impact of some of these interventions – for example, that structured pedagogy interventions 
help students to learn what they would normally learn in between 0.6 and 0.9 years of business‐as‐usual 

                                                                                                                     13 
 
schooling – is in part driven by the low quality of “business as usual” schooling in many countries. The 
same  interventions  implemented  in  Finland  or  Singapore  might  have  a  much  smaller  relative  impact. 
However, “business as usual” schooling is the current reality and the interventions discussed in this study 
have the potential to significantly increase its productivity.
